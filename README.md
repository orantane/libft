# libft
Hive Helsinki school project to create our own library of useful functions.

At the school we are only allowed to use very few C-library functions, so we needed to create our own library of useful functions.

The library is compiled by using the command 'make libft', recompiled with 'make re', cleaned with 'make clean' and totally cleaned including the library file with 'make fclean'.
